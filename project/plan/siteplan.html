    <h1>Heaven's Door - Site Plan</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p><strong>Heaven's Door</strong> - It's a Jojo reference. Also because I wanted to go for an ethereal
            aesthetic. It fits perfectly with the theme of how these artists' skills have reached a point where you'd
            start to ask if it was even made on Earth.</p>
        
            <p>Optional domain: heavensdoor.com</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The website will provide a personally curated selection of classic Christian artworkâ€”paintings that depict
            stories from the scriptures or express spiritual truths. Each piece will be accompanied by a short write-up
            or reflection to help viewers appreciate its depth. This site will aim to be a quiet place of inspiration
            and reverence, inviting others to find meaning through art.</p>
